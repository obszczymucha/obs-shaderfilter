# obs-shaderfilter

## Introduction

The obs-shaderfilter plugin for [OBS Studio](http://obsproject.com/) is intended to allow users to apply 
their own shaders to OBS sources. This theoretically makes possible some simple effects like drop shadows
that can be implemented strictly in shader code. 

Please note that this plugin may expose a reasonable number of bugs in OBS, as it uses the shader parser and 
the property system in somewhat unusual ways.

## Installation

The binary package mirrors the structure of the OBS Studio installation directory, so you should be able to
just drop its contents alongside an OBS Studio install (usually at C:\Program Files\obs-studio\). The 
necessary files should look like this:

        |   |---obs-shaderfilter.dll
        |---64bit
            |---obs-shaderfilter.dll

## Usage

The filter can be added to any source through the "Filters" option when right-clicking on a source. The name
of the filter is "User-defined shader." 

Shaders can either be entered directly in a text box in the filter properties, or loaded from a file. To change 
between the two modes, use the "Load shader text from file" toggle. If you are entering your shader text directly,
note that you will need to use the "Reload effect" button to apply your changes. This can also be used to reload an external file if changes have been made. 
OBS shaders are written in OBS version of HLSL.

The option is provided to render extra pixels on each side of the source. This is useful for effects like shadows
that need to render outside the bounds of the original source. 

Normally, all that's required for OBS purposes is a pixel shader, so the plugin will wrap your shader text with a 
standard template to add a basic vertex shader and other boilerplate. If you wish to customize the vertex shader
or other parts of the effect for some reason, you can check the "Use Effect File (.effect)" option. 

Any parameters you add to your shader (defined as `uniform` variables) will be detected by the plugin and exposed
in the properties window to have their values set. Currently, only `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `texture2d`, and `float4`
parameters are supported. (`float4` parameters will be interpreted by the properties window as colors.) `string` is used for 
notes and instructions, but could be used in an effect or shader. Variable names are displayed in the GUI with underscore replaced with space `uniform float Variable_Name` becomes `Variable Name`.

Version 2.0 and up support setting label, widget_type, minimum, maximum, step using annotations.
Version 2.1 and up support setting group using annotations.
A slider that has a minimum of -1.0, maximum of 1.0, and a step size of 0.01:
```
// Contrast from -1.0 to 1.0
uniform float Contrast<
  string label = "Contrast Adjustment";
  string widget_type = "slider";
  string group = "Group";
  float minimum = -1.0;
  float maximum = 1.0;
  float step = 0.01;
> = 0.0;
```
A drop-down select widget for integer fields:
```
uniform int SelectTest<
  string label = "Int Select";
  string widget_type = "select";
  int    option_0_value = 0;
  string option_0_label = "First";
  int    option_1_value = 1;
  string option_1_label = "Second";
  int    option_2_value = 3;
  string option_2_label = "Third";
> = 3;
```
A text field the user can not edit:
```
uniform string notes<
    string widget_type = "info";
> = "add notes here";
```

#### Defaults

You set default values as a normal assignment ```uniform string notes = 'my note';```, except for `float4` 
which requires bracket \{\} notation like ```uniform float4 mycolor = { 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 1.0};``` 

Note that if your shader has syntax errors and fails to compile, OBS does not provide any error messages; you will
simply see your source render nothing at all. In many cases the output of the effect parser will be written to the
OBS log file, which you can view with the Help -> Log Files menu in OBS. 

### Standard parameters

The plugin automatically populates a few parameters which your shader can use. If you choose to override the entire
effect, be sure to define these as `uniform` variables and use them where necessary. (The filter should gracefully 
handle these variables being missing, but the shader may malfunction.)

* **`ViewProj`** (`float4x4`)&mdash;The view/projection matrix. (Standard for all OBS filters.)
* **`image`** (`texture2d`)&mdash;The image to which the filter is being applied, either the original output of 
  the source or the output of the previous filter in the chain. (Standard for all OBS filters.)
* **`prevous_image`** (`texture2d`)&mdash;The previous image to which the filter is being applied (2.5.0)
* **`elapsed_time`** (`float`)&mdash;The time in seconds which has elapsed since the filter was created. Useful for 
  creating animations.
* **`elapsed_time_start`** (`float`)&mdash;The time in seconds which has elapsed since the shader was loaded (2.4.0).
* **`elapsed_time_show`** (`float`)&mdash;The time in seconds which has elapsed since the filter was shown (2.4.0).
* **`elapsed_time_active`** (`float`)&mdash;The time in seconds which has elapsed since the filter has become active (2.4.0).
* **`elapsed_time_enable`** (`float`)&mdash;The time in seconds which has elapsed since the filter was enabled (2.4.0).
* **`local_time`** (`float`)&mdash; a random float representing the local time.(1.2)
* **`loops`** (`int`)&mdash; count of how many seconds the shader has rendered a page.(1.2)
* **`loop_second`** (`float`)&mdash; a float going from 0.0 to 1.0 each loop.(2.4.0)
* **`current_time_ms`** (`int`)&mdash; the microseconds (0 to 999) of the current time.(2.4.1)
* **`current_time_sec`** (`int`)&mdash; the seconds (0 to 59) of the current time.(2.4.1)
* **`current_time_min`** (`int`)&mdash; the minutes (0 to 59) of the current time.(2.4.1)
* **`current_time_hour`** (`int`)&mdash; the hours (0 to 23) of the current time.(2.4.1)
* **`current_time_day_of_week`** (`int`)&mdash; the day of the week (0 to 6) of the current time.(2.4.1)
* **`current_time_day_of_month`** (`int`)&mdash; the day of the month (1 to 31) of the current time.(2.4.1)
* **`current_time_month`** (`int`)&mdash; the month (0 to 11) of the current time.(2.4.1)
* **`current_time_day_of_year`** (`int`)&mdash; the day of the month (0 to 365) of the current time.(2.4.1)
* **`current_time_year`** (`int`)&mdash; the number of years since 1900 of the current time.(2.4.1)
* **`rand_f`** (`float`)&mdash; a random float between 0 and 1. changes per frame.
* **`rand_activation_f`** (`float`)&mdash; a random float between 0 and 1. changes per activation, load or change of settings.(1.2)
* **`rand_instance_f`** (`float`)&mdash; a random float between 0 and 1. changes per instance on load.(1.2)
* **`uv_offset`** (`float2`)&mdash;The offset which should be applied to the UV coordinates of the vertices. This is
  used in the standard vertex shader to draw extra pixels on the borders of the source.
* **`uv_scale`** (`float2`)&mdash;The scale which should be applied to the UV coordinates of the vertices. This is 
  used in the standard vertex shader to draw extra pixels on the borders of the source.
* **`uv_size`** (`float2`)&mdash;The height and width of the screen.
* **`uv_pixel_interval`** (`float2`)&mdash;This is the size in UV coordinates of an individual texel. You can use
  this to convert the UV coordinates of the pixel being processed to the coordinates of that texel in the source
  texture, or otherwise scale UV coordinate distances into texel distances.
* **`prevous_output`** (`texture2d`)&mdash;The previous output of the filter (2.5.0)
* **`audio_peak`** (`float`)&mdash;The instantaneous maximum audio level (peak) from the selected audio source, normalized to 0.0-1.0.
  More reactive to sudden sounds like drums.
* **`audio_magnitude`** (`float`)&mdash;The RMS (Root Mean Square) audio level from the selected audio source, normalized to 0.0-1.0.
  Smoother representation of sustained audio levels.

### Optional Preprocessing Macros

The plugin provides some optional pre-processing macros.

* **`#include "<path-to-file>"`** The include macro will insert the contents file at the path `<path-to-file>` before the shader is compiled. This is useful to place commonly used functions, in a separate file that can be used by multiple shaders.  E.g.: `#include "util-fns.effect"`.
* **`#define <NAME> <value>`** This allows you to define constants to be used throughout your shader. Constants can be values or even simple functions. Anywhere the value in `<NAME>` is found in your shader, it will be replaced with whatever is in `<value>`.  For example, after putting `#define PI 3.14159` near the top of your shader file, you can use code like: `float circle_area = PI * radius * radius;`.  Note, the `#define` line should NOT be ended with a semicolon.
* **`#define USE_PM_ALPHA 1`** By default, OBS will pass through pre-multiplied alpha color values. This can cause issues if the source being filtered has opacity values that are not zero or one. By default, shaderfilter now corrects internally for premultipled alpha, but if you have written an older shader that does the correction itself, you can turn off the correction by placing `#define USE_PM_ALPHA 1` near the top of your shader file.

### Example shaders

Several examples are provided in the plugin's *data/examples* folder. These can be used as-is for some hopefully
useful common tasks, or used as a reference in developing your own shaders. Note that the *.shader* and *.effect* 
extensions are for clarity only, and have no specific meaning to the plugin. Text files with any extension can be
loaded. In a standard, *.effect* files include a vertex shader and *.shader* only has a pixel shader.

I recommend *.shader* as they do not require `Use Effect File (.effect)` as pixel shaders, while *.effect* signifies vertex shaders with `Use Effect File (.effect)` required.

and the OBS Studio libraries and headers.

* [obs-shaderfilter source repository](https://github.com/exeldro/obs-shaderfilter)
* [OBS Studio source repository](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio)

1. In-tree build
    - Build OBS Studio: https://obsproject.com/wiki/Install-Instructions
    - Check out this repository to plugins/obs-shaderfilter
    - Add `add_subdirectory(obs-shaderfilter)` to plugins/CMakeLists.txt
    - Rebuild OBS Studio

1. Stand-alone build (Linux only)
    - Verify that you have package with development files for OBS
    - Check out this repository and run `cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_OUT_OF_TREE=On && cmake --build build`
