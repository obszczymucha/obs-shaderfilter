/*
EXPLANATION:
- audio_peak: Shows instantaneous maximum levels, very responsive to drums/percussion.
- audio_magnitude: Shows RMS (Root Mean Square) levels, smoother and represents sustained audio.

TYPICAL BEHAVIOR:
- With music containing drums: Left side (peak) will flash more dramatically on beats.
- With sustained tones: Right side (magnitude) will show more consistent levels.
- Peak reacts faster to sudden sounds, magnitude is more stable for smooth effects.
